        <h1>Base Style</h1>
        <p>This style guide exemplifies the base styles.</p>

      <section>
        <p class="h3">Creating a well thought out base style for a new website is one of the most critical parts to ensure an overall successful project progression.</p>
        <p>The base style should contain all those basic HTML elements and their variations that will be needed within the website. May it be in standard formatted text, or within custom styled layout components.</p>
        <p>The goal is to abstract the element designs just to the right level, so that they can be used in any context without further modifications, but to keep them flexible enough for custom adjustments when needed, without having to overwrite many CSS attributes.</p>
        <p>The following markup is a best practice starting point to help you focus on what's important. It does not include <em>all</em> HTML elements, but as the theme is using <em>normalize.css</em>, elements will still be recoginzably styled, only without further customization.</p>

        <p>One morning, when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gregor+samsa" target="_blank">Gregor Samsa</a> woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>A caption for this image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
        <blockquote><p>Base styling is done, when this page has a custom look and is visually structured so that all elements, their relationships, meanings and hierarchy are recognizable.</p></blockquote>
        <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.<br>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
        <p>Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this <strong>nonsense</strong>", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.</p>
        <p>He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.</p>

        <h2>Lists are very common and may be nested</h2>
        <p>Make sure you're not resetting all list elements, because that might come in handy for styling other layout elements, but remain their purpose for formatted text.</p>
        <h3>What you need to consider</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What's the margin and padding of the list?</li>
          <li>Which list style is the default?</li>
          <li>Will there be custom list style icons like:
            <ol>
              <li>stars</li>
              <li>checkmarks</li>
              <li>colored bullets or list numbers</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Nested list styles should have a different look.
            <ul>
              <li>The user agent stylesheet does that already.</li>
              <li>So custom styled lists should consider it as well.</li>
              <li>An option might be to only specifically style the top level list style icon to keep the browser defaults for nesting.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Also remember to test multiline list items like the one above.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's also important to see those lists within the content flow, so margins and paddings fit with surrounding text. And of course, also consider <strong>ordered lists</strong> like the following.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's basically the same</li>
          <li>But different</li>
          <li>And they may also nest other lists:
            <ol>
              <li>may it be another ordered list,</li>
              <li>or an unoredered list.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The best part is:
            <ul>
              <li>this boring copy ends here!</li>
              <li>Because I <em>really</em> don't know what else to write here.</li>
              <li>Hope it'll still be more helpful than lorem ipsum.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>But don't stop here!</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!".</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why would I need a definition list element?</dt>
          <dd>Because there might be an accordion on the website which would semantically enjoy being definied as a definition list!</dd>
          <dt>But that styling would be part of a component, or wouldn't it?</dt>
          <dd>Sure! The specific styling and functionality might be part of that component, but it's still nice to set some base styling, like font-weight, margins and paddings, so it'll follow the content flow of the page.</dd>
          <dt>Any other use cases?</dt>
          <dd>Not too sure about it, besides some special ones I have hardly seen. Anyone?</dd>

        <h2>Headline H2 is such a common element</h2>
        <p>He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.</p>
        <p>He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.</p>
        <p>For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I <em>ought</em> to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.</p>
        <h3>Headline H3 will also be used all over the website</h3>
        <p>If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk!</p>
        <p>And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's <strong>definitely</strong> what I'll do.</p>
        <p>That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.</p>
        <h4>Headline H4 is nice for alternative smaller styles</h4>
        <p>Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now?</p>
        <p>The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.</p>
        <h5>Headline H5 is unloved, but can be powerfull as a helper class</h5>
        <p>And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago.</p>
        <p>The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.</p>
        <h6>Headline H6 is very rare but might be a small alternative</h6>
        <p>His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.</p>
        <p>And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.</p>
