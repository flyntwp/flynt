# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

# What's Timber?
Timber combines the simple readability of the [Twig template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), and combines it with an object oriented, consistent approach to Wordpress posts, images, terms, users and more.

To find out more about Timber's functionality, we strongly recommend reading through the [official Timber documentation](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/).

## Do I have to use Timber and Twig?

No, this is just our personal recommendation. You can easily change this with the `renderComponent` filter. [Learn how here](../theme-development/changing-templating-language.md).

## Do I have to use Stylus?

No, this is just our personal recommendation. You can use plain CSS without needing to change anything, or setup your pre-processor of choice with Gulp. [Learn more here](../theme-development/changing-styling-language.md).

## What's Rupture?

Rupture is a simple utility for working with media queries in stylus. It takes advantage of Stylus block mixins to provide a series of useful helpers that make using breakpoints clean and intuitive. [You can read more on their official website](http://jescalan.github.io/rupture/).

Of course, as with everything else - you do not have to use this, but we strongly recommend it!

## Do I have to use Custom Elements to write Javascript?

No, this is just our personal recommendation. You can author your Javascript however you wish!

## Do I have to use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)?

No, but this is very strongly recommended.
