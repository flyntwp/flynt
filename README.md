* [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) >= 5.7

## Troubleshooting

### Images

In some setups images may not show up, returning a 404 by the server.

The most common reason for this is that you are using nginx and your server is not set up in the default way. You can see that this is the case, if an image url return a 404 from nginx, not from WordPress itself.

In this case, please add something like

```nginx
location ~ "^(.*)/wp-content/uploads/(.*)$" {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
}
```

to your site config.

Other issues might come from Flynt not being able to determine the relative url of your uploads folder. If you have a non-standard WordPress folder structure, or if you use a plugin that manipulates `home_url` (for example, [WPML](https://wpml.org/)) this can cause problems when using `resizeDynamic`.

In this care try to set the relative upload path manually and refresh the permalink settings in the back-end:

```php
add_filter('Flynt/TimberDynamicResize/relativeUploadDir', function () {
    return '/app/uploads'; // Example for Bedrock installs.
});
```

### Browsersync

In some cases, browsersync may be not working. Usually this is related to WordPress not running on https. In order to fix this issue, change the `browsersync.https` value to `false` in the file `build-config.js`.

## Usage
In your terminal, navigate to `<your-project>/wp-content/themes/flynt` and run `npm start`. This will start a local server at `localhost:3000`.

All files in `assets` and `Components` will now be watched for changes and compiled to the `dist` folder. Happy coding!

Flynt comes with a ready to use Base Style built according to our best practices for building simple, maintainable components. Go to `localhost:3000/BaseStyle` to see it in action.

### Assets

The `./assets` folder contains all global JavaScript, SCSS, images, and font files for the theme. Files inside this folder are watched for changes and compile to `./dist`.

The `main.scss` file is compiled to `./dist/assets/main.css` which is enqueued in the front-end.

The `admin.scss` file is compiled to `./dist/assets/admin.css` which is enqueued in the administrator back-end of WordPress, so styles added to this file will take effect only in the back-end.

### Lib & Inc

The `./lib` folder includes helper functions and basic setup logic. *You will most likely not need to modify any files inside `./lib`.* All files in the `./lib` folder are autoloaded via PSR-4.

The `./inc` folder is a more organised version of WordPress' `functions.php` and contains all custom theme logic. All files in the `./inc` folder are automatically required.

For organisation, `./inc` has three subfolders. We recommend using these three folders to keep the theme well-structured:

- `customPostTypes`<br> Use this folder to register custom WordPress post types.
- `customTaxonomies`<br> Use this folder to register custom WordPress taxonomies.
- `fieldGroups`<br> Use this folder to register Advanced Custom Fields field groups. (See [Field Groups](#field-groups) for more information.)

After the files from `./lib` and `./inc` are loaded, all [components](#components) from the `./Components` folder are loaded.

### Page Templates
Flynt uses [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) to structure its page templates and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) for rendering them. [Timber's documentation](https://timber.github.io/docs/) is extensive and up to date, so be sure to get familiar with it.

There is one Twig function added in Flynt to render components into templates:
* `renderComponent(componentName, data)` renders a single component. [For example, in the `index.twig` template](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/templates/index.twig).

Besides the main document structure (in `./templates/_document.twig`), everything else is a component.

### Components
A component is a self-contained building-block. Each component contains its own layout, its ACF fields, PHP logic, scripts, and styles.

```
  ExampleComponent/
  ├── functions.php
  ├── index.twig
  ├── README.md
  ├── screenshot.png
  ├── script.js
  ├── style.scss
```

The `functions.php` file for every component in the `./Components` folder is executed during the WordPress action `after_setup_theme`. [This is run from the `./functions.php` file of the theme.](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/functions.php)

To render components into a template, see [Page Templates](#page-templates).

### Advanced Custom Fields
Defining Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) can be done in `functions.php` for each component. As a best practise, we recommend defining your fields inside a function named `getACFLayout()` which you can then call in a [field group](#field-groups).

For example:

```php
namespace Flynt\Components\BlockWysiwyg;

function getACFLayout()
{
    return [
        'name' => 'blockWysiwyg',
        'label' => 'Block: Wysiwyg',
        'sub_fields' => [
            [
                'label' => __('Content', 'flynt'),
                'name' => 'contentHtml',
                'type' => 'wysiwyg',
                'delay' => 1,
                'media_upload' => 0,
                'required' => 1,
            ],
        ]
    ];
}
```

### Field Groups
Field groups are needed to show registered fields in the WordPress back-end. All field groups are created in the `./inc/fieldGroups` folder. Two field groups exist by default: [`pageComponents.php`](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/inc/fieldGroups/pageComponents.php) and [`postComponents.php`](https://github.com/flyntwp/flynt/tree/master/inc/fieldGroups/postComponents.php).

We call the function `getACFLayout()` defined in the `functions.php` file of each component to load fields into a field group.

For example:

```php
use ACFComposer\ACFComposer;
use Flynt\Components;

add_action('Flynt/afterRegisterComponents', function () {
    ACFComposer::registerFieldGroup([
        'name' => 'pageComponents',
        'title' => 'Page Components',
        'style' => 'seamless',
        'fields' => [
            [
                'name' => 'pageComponents',
                'label' => __('Page Components', 'flynt'),
                'type' => 'flexible_content',
                'button_label' => 'Add Component',
                'layouts' => [
                    Components\BlockWysiwyg\getACFLayout(),
                ]
            ]
        ],
        'location' => [
            [
                [
                    'param' => 'post_type',
                    'operator' => '==',
                    'value' => 'page'
                ],
                [
                    'param' => 'page_type',
                    'operator' => '!=',
                    'value' => 'posts_page'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]);
});
```

Here we use the [ACF Field Group Composer](https://github.com/flyntwp/acf-field-group-composer) plugin, which provides the advantage that all fields automatically get a unique key.

### ACF Option Pages
Flynt includes several utility functions for creating Advanced Custom Fields options pages. Briefly, these are:

* `Flynt\Utils\Options::addTranslatable`<br> Adds fields into a new group inside the Translatable Options options page. When used with the WPML plugin, these fields will be returned in the current language.
* `Flynt\Utils\Options::addGlobal`<br> Adds fields into a new group inside the Global Options options page. When used with WPML, these fields will always be returned from the primary language. In this way these fields are *global* and cannot be translated.
* `Flynt\Utils\Options::getTranslatable` <br> Retrieve a translatable option.
* `Flynt\Utils\Options::getGlobal` <br> Retrieve a global option.

### Dynamic Resize & WebP Generation

Timber provides [a `resize` filter to resize images](https://timber.github.io/docs/reference/timber-imagehelper/#resize). This filter creates all images on the page when it's loaded for the first time. If there are many images on one page then this can lead to a very slow load time, or even a complete timeout.

Flynt solves this with the `resizeDynamic` filter. This filter only generates images when the image is requested, rather than when the page is loaded.

All of the generated images are stored in `uploads/dynamic`. If you want to manually regenerate all of these images you can delete this folder and the next time an image is requested it will be regenerated.

`resizeDynamic` also creates a WebP file of each image it resizes. For this to work, it adds a rewrite rule to `.htaccess` so that Apache will automatically serve the WebP version to all browsers that support it.

You can disable the dynamic resize functionality and WebP generation by using the filters `Flynt/TimberDynamicResize/disableDynamic` and `Flynt/TimberDynamicResize/disableWebp`. If you change the enable dynamic resizing again, make sure to flush your permalinks.
